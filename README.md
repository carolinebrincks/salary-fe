# 🤖 AI Salary Predictor

This repository contains the codebase for an AI-powered salary prediction tool built as part of a class project. The web app allows users to input demographic and career information through drop-down menus and receive a predicted salary estimate based on that data.

## 🧠 About the Project

The goal of this project was to explore how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used to make predictions based on user input. This app predicts salary based on the following user-selected inputs:

- **Age Group**
- **Occupation**
- **Gender**
- **Education Level**
- **Country**

Once a user selects their details, the app processes the input and returns an estimated salary based on trained data models.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Visual Studio Code** – for writing and editing code
- **GitHub Desktop** – for version control and repository management
- **Postman** – for testing and managing API requests
- **Namecheap** – for custom domain linking
- **Azure / Web Hosting Platform** – for deploying the live web app

## 💻 Features

- Dropdown menus for structured, user-friendly input
- Real-time salary prediction response
- API functionality tested via Postman
- Deployed online with a custom domain

## 🌐 Deployment Setup

1. Developed locally using **VS Code** and versioned with **GitHub Desktop**
2. Tested backend API functionality using **Postman**
3. Hosted the site using a web platform (e.g., Azure Static Web Apps or App Service)
4. Linked a custom domain from **Namecheap**
   - Configured DNS settings to point to the hosting service
   - Connected and verified domain in hosting platform
